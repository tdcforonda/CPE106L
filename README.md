# ðŸš€ðŸš€ Game of War ðŸš€ðŸš€
Game of War is a two-person game that uses a deck of cards.
<ul>
  <li>One deck consists of 52 playing cards, each with a numeric value between 1 and 13 (rank of the card) and one of four suits.</li>
  <li>The values 1, 11, 12, and 13 have special names: ace, jack, queen, and king, respectively, with the ace counting as the highest.</li>
  <li>The entire deck is dealt between the two players.</li>
  <li>The players have 26 cards face down on the table.</li>
  <li>Each turn, the players show the top card from their piles.</li>
  <li>The player with the highest ranking cards wins both of the cards, putting them face up in a pile.</li>
  <li>If it turns out to be a tie, each player places the number of cards equal to that rank face down on the table.</li>
  <li>The last cards playes by each player are turned over and compared, the higher value wins all of the cards that have been played this turn.</li>
  <li>When a player finishes playing all of the cards in his or her playing pile, the carsd won in previous turns are turned over and become and new playing pile.</li>
  <li>If either player cannot complete a turn for lack of cards, the other player wins the game.</li>
</ul>

## Software Design Laboratory
In partial fulfillment of the course **Software Design Laboratory** with the subject code **CPE106L** for **Prof. Dionis Padilla**.

The objective of this project is to illustrate the process of designing an object-oriented solution to a small problem by simulating the card game.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7
2. Git bash terminal OR Ubuntu terminal

## Installation

```
git clone https://www.github.com/tdcforonda/CPE106L.git
cd CPE106L
python war.py
```
